# Data viz — top 5 product concepts (initial)

1) **Public “living dashboard” for a city / region**
   - Use open municipal data (311, permits, transit, crime, air quality) with time-series + map layers.
   - Data sources: NYC Open Data (template for API-backed catalog): https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/

2) **Open-data explorer with “dataset search → instant charts”**
   - User pastes a dataset URL or finds via Dataset Search; app profiles schema, suggests chart types, creates shareable views.
   - Dataset discovery: https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/

3) **Embedded analytics for niche SaaS ("Power BI Embedded-like", but simpler)**
   - Target small SaaS vendors that want customer-facing analytics without standing up full BI.
   - Competitive reference: Power BI Embedded: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/

4) **Narrative data stories (scrollytelling) generator**
   - Convert an analysis notebook into a publishable story with annotations, embeds, and export.
   - Competitive reference: Observable notebooks + sharing/embeds: https://observablehq.com/

5) **Compliance / ops monitoring dashboard pack**
   - Pre-built templates for common operational metrics (SLA, incident timelines, audit logs), with alerts.
   - Use open-source charting + connectors; can integrate with public datasets when helpful (e.g., outages, weather).

## Notes / next iteration
- Validate each concept’s ICP (analyst, journalist, gov, SaaS PM) + willingness to pay.
- Add 1-sentence MVP definition + moat per concept.
